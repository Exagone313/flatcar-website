  body: "**NOTE** LTS-2021 is near the designated end of its 18 month lifespan and\
    \ will only receive 1 more update by the end of September. If you use a fixed\
    \ LTS channel please switch to LTS-2022, the new LTS which has been published\
    \ in May. After the next update by end of September  there will be no more releases\
    \ for the LTS-2021 channel. Please check your nodes' `GROUP=` setting in `/etc/flatcar/update.conf`\
    \ to determine if you need to take action. Please refer to the Flatcar documentation\
    \ on [switching channels](https://flatcar-linux.org/docs/latest/setup/releases/switching-channels/#freezing-an-lts-stream)\
    \ to switch to LTS-2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Changes since **LTS 2605.30.1**_\r\n\r\n\
    #### Security fixes:\r\n\r\n- Linux ([CVE-2021-4159](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4159),\
    \ [CVE-2022-1462](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1462), [CVE-2022-20369](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-20369),\
    \ [CVE-2022-21505](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21505), [CVE-2022-26373](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-26373),\
    \ [CVE-2022-36123](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36123), [CVE-2022-36879](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36879),\
    \ [CVE-2022-36946](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36946))\r\n\r\n####\
    \ Changes:\r\n\r\n- The new image signing subkey was added to the public key embedded\
    \ into `flatcar-install` (the old expired on 10th August 2022), only an updated\
    \ `flatcar-install` script can verify releases signed with the new key ([init#79](https://github.com/flatcar-linux/init/pull/79))\r\
    \n\r\n#### Updates:\r\n\r\n- Linux ([5.4.210](https://lwn.net/Articles/904463)\
    \ (includes [5.4.209](https://lwn.net/Articles/903690), [5.4.208](https://lwn.net/Articles/902919),\
    \ [5.4.207](https://lwn.net/Articles/902103)))\r\n- ca-certificates ([3.82](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/security/nss/releases/nss_3_82.html))\r\
    \n\r\nNote: LTS 2605.32.1 i.e the next release to be release in the month of September\
    \ would be the last release for LTS-2021. Post that there will be no more releases\
    \ for the channel. Please upgrade your workloads to LTS-2022 as soon as possible.\r\
